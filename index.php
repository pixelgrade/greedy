        <h1>My Bad</h1>
        <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>
        <h2>Born Free</h2>
        <p>I am not a killer. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
            <li>Keep your mind limber.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Father Knows Best</h3>
        <p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>
        <h4>Waiting to Exhale</h4>
        <p>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm really more an apartment person. Keep your mind limber. You look&hellip;perfect. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Hello, Dexter Morgan.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
            <li>I'm doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Slack Tide</h5>
        <p>Tell him time is of the essence. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
